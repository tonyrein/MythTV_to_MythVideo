Package DTO has classes that handle data in RAM and in transit. It does not concern itself with the storage of the data - for that it uses objects in the SERVICE package.

Class ProgInfo
This class has information about a program. A "program" is an MPG file, which MythTV can provide to viewers either by the Watch Recordings or the Watch Videos interface. No matter whether the file represents a tv program, a video, or neither (ie, the file is an "orphan"), it will have associated with it the following:
filename, filesize, title, subtitle, host, directory

If the file is an "orphan," the title and subtitle will be supplied by a human; otherwise, they will already be available in MythTV's "mythconverg" database. (Accessing the database will be the responsibility of the lower-level classes used by the high-level classes in SERVICE.)

ProgInfo is the parent class for VidInfo, TvInfo, and OrphanInfo. The child classes will have additional data attributes specific to their functions.
